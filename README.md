Outline

It's been awhile since I've used Javascript so I wanted to do a quick project to brush up my skills before beginning to learn ReactJS. I figured a simple calculator would be a good refresher. The calculator is designed with flexbox, basic CSS for the styling, and HTML for the buttons. The calculator will cover all basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and even a combination of all of them. The calculator will carry out itâ€™s operations using event listeners when a button is clicked.

Goals

  -Brush up on CSS flexbox skills
 
 -Brush up on Javascript, especially dom manipulation since I want to make sure I understand     what is going on under the hood when I learn React.
